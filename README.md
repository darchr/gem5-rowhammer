# The gem5 Simulator

This is the repository for the gem5 simulator. It contains the full source code
for the simulator and all tests and regressions.

The gem5 simulator is a modular platform for computer-system architecture
research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor
microarchitecture. It is primarily used to evaluate new hardware designs,
system software changes, and compile-time and run-time system optimizations.

The main website can be found at <http://www.gem5.org>.

## Testing status

**Note**: These regard tests run on the develop branch of gem5:
<https://github.com/gem5/gem5/tree/develop>.

[![Weekly Tests](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/weekly-tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/weekly-tests.yaml)

## Getting started

A good starting point is <http://www.gem5.org/about>, and for
more information about building the simulator and getting started
please see <http://www.gem5.org/documentation> and
<http://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction>.

## Building gem5

To build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,
Python (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, zlib, m4, and lastly
protobuf if you want trace capture and playback support. Please see
<http://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building> for more details
concerning the minimum versions of these tools.

### Compiling HammerSim

HammerSim has the following dependencies:
* json: `ext/json`. Follow the `README` in `ext/json` to compile json.

Once you have all dependencies resolved, execute
`scons build/ALL/gem5.opt` to build an optimized version of the gem5 binary
(`gem5.opt`) containing all gem5 ISAs. If you only wish to compile gem5 to
include a single ISA, you can replace `ALL` with the name of the ISA. Valid
options include `ARM`, `NULL`, `MIPS`, `POWER`, `RISCV`, `SPARC`, and `X86`
The complete list of options can be found in the build_opts directory.

See https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building for more
information on building gem5.

## The Source Tree

The main source tree includes these subdirectories:

* build_opts: pre-made default configurations for gem5
* build_tools: tools used internally by gem5's build process.
* configs: example simulation configuration scripts
* ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5
* include: include files for use in other programs
* site_scons: modular components of the build system
* src: source code of the gem5 simulator. The C++ source, Python wrappers, and Python standard library are found in this directory.
* system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems
* tests: regression tests
* util: useful utility programs and files

## Using HammerSim

Please see `README-RH.md`.

## gem5 Resources

To run full-system simulations, you may need compiled system firmware, kernel
binaries and one or more disk images, depending on gem5's configuration and
what type of workload you're trying to run. Many of these resources can be
obtained from <https://resources.gem5.org>.

More information on gem5 Resources can be found at
<https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/gem5_resources/>.
